## 1. Introduction to R & RStudio

> ## Challenge 1 {.challenge}
>
> What will be the value of each  variable  after each
> statement in the following program?
>
> ```{r, eval=FALSE}
> mass <- 47.5
> age <- 122
> mass <- mass * 2.3
> age <- age + 1
> ```
>

> ## Challenge 2 {.challenge}
>
> Run the code from the previous challenge, and write a command to
> compare mass to age. Is mass larger than age?
>

> ## Challenge 3 {.challenge}
>
> Clean up your working environment by deleting the mass and age
> variables.
>

> ## Challenge 4 {.challenge}
> 
> Install the following packages: `ggplot2`, `plyr`, `gapminder`
> 

# 2. project intro

> ## Challenge 1 {.challenge}
> Download the gapminder data from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv).
>
> 1. Download the file (CTRL + S, right mouse click -> "Save as", or File -> "Save page as")
> 2. Make sure it's saved under the name `gapminder-FiveYearData.csv`
> 3. Save the file in the `data/` folder within your project.
>
> We will load and inspect these data later.

# 3. 04 data structures
> ## Challenge 1.1
>
> Start by making a vector with the numbers 1 through 26.
> Multiply the vector by 2, and give the resulting vector
> names A through Z (hint: there is a built in vector called `LETTERS`)
>

> ## Challenge 2
>
> Is there a factor in our `cats` data.frame? what is its name?
> Try using `?read.csv` to figure out how to keep text columns as character
> vectors instead of factors; then write a command or two to show that the factor
> in `cats` is actually a character vector when loaded in this way.

# 4. vectorisation

> ## Challenge 3
>
> Given the following matrix:
>
> ```{r}
> m <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3, ncol=4)
> m
> ```
>
> Write down what you think will happen when you run:
>
> 1. `m ^ -1`
> 2. `m * c(1, 0, -1)`
> 3. `m > c(0, 20)`
> 4. `m * c(1, 0, -1, 2)`
>
> Did you get the output you expected? If not, ask a helper!
>



> ## Challenge 4
>
> We're interested in looking at the sum of the
> following sequence of fractions:
>
> ```{r, eval=FALSE}
>  x = 1/(1^2) + 1/(2^2) + 1/(3^2) + ... + 1/(n^2)
> ```
>
> This would be tedious to type out, and impossible for high values of
> n.  Use vectorisation to compute x when n=100. What is the sum when
> n=10,000?

# 5. 06 data subsetting 1
> ## Challenge 1
>
> Given the following code:
>
> ```{r}
> x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
> names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
> print(x)
> ```
>
> Come up with at least 2 different commands that will produce the following output:
>
> ```{r, echo=FALSE}
> x[2:4]
> ```
>
> After you find 2 different commands, compare notes with your neighbour. Did you have different strategies?
>

> ## Challenge 2
>
> Given the following code:
>
> ```{r}
> x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
> names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
> print(x)
> ```
>
> Write a subsetting command to return the values in x that are greater than 4 and less than 7.

When one vector is shorter than the other, it gets *recycled*:

> ## Challenge 3
>
> 3.1 Make a vector with the names of the months as the vector names and the day counts as the values
> January - 31 days
> February - 28 days
> March - 31 days
> April - 30 days
> May - 31 days
> June - 30 days
> July - 31 days
> August - 31 days
> September - 30 days
> October - 31 days
> November - 30 days
> December - 31 days
>
> 3.2 get the months with more than 30 days
> 3.3 get the number of days in the last three months of the year, then the last 6 months of the year
> 3.4 get the number of days that May and March have
> 3.5 extra challenge: get the number of days in every second month (hint: look up the "seq" function)


> ## Challenge 4

> Given the following code:
>
> ```{r}
> m <- matrix(1:18, nrow=3, ncol=6)
> print(m)
> ```
>
> 1. Which of the following commands will extract the values 11 and 14?
>
> A. `m[2,4,2,5]`
>
> B. `m[2:5]`
>
> C. `m[4:5,2]`
>
> D. `m[2,c(4,5)]`

> ## Challenge 5
> Given the following list:
>
> ```{r, eval=FALSE}
> xlist <- list(a = "Software Carpentry", b = 1:10, data = head(iris))
> ```
>
> Using your knowledge of both list and vector subsetting, extract the number 2 from xlist.
> Hint: the number 2 is contained within the "b" item in the list.

> ## Challenge 6
> Given a linear model:
>
> ```{r, eval=FALSE}
> mod <- aov(pop ~ lifeExp, data=gapminder)
> ```
>
> Extract the residual degrees of freedom (hint: `attributes()` will help you)

# 6. 5 data structures 2

> ## Challenge 1
> Let's imagine that 1 human year is equivalent to 7 cat years. 
> 1. Create a vector called `human_age` by multiplying `cats$age` by 7.
> 2. Convert `human_age` to a factor.
> 3. Convert `human_age` back to a numeric vector using the `as.numeric()` function. Now divide it by 7 to get the original ages back. Explain what happened.
>



> ## Challenge 2
>
> You can create a new data frame right from within R with the following syntax:
> ```{r}
> df <- data.frame(id = c("a", "b", "c"),
>                  x = 1:3,
>                  y = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE),
>                  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
> ```
> Make a data frame that holds the following information for yourself:
>
> - first name
> - last name
> - lucky number
>
> Then use `rbind` to add an entry for the people sitting beside you.
> Finally, use `cbind` to add a column with each person's answer to the question, "Is it time for coffee break?"
>

> ## Challenge 3
>
> It's good practice to also check the last few lines of your data and some in the middle. How would you do this?
>
> Extra challenge: Searching for ones specifically in the middle isn't too hard or we could simply ask for a few lines at random. How would you code this? (hint: check out the sample() or runif() functions using ?sample )
>


> ## Challenge 5
>
> Read the output of `str(gapminder)` again;
> this time, use what you've learned about factors, lists and vectors,
> as well as the output of functions like `colnames` and `dim`
> to explain what everything that `str` prints out for gapminder means.
> If there are any parts you can't interpret, discuss with your neighbors!

# 7. 13 dplyr

> ## Challenge 1
>
> Write a single command (which can span multiple lines and includes pipes) that
> will produce a dataframe that has the African values for `lifeExp`, `country`
> and `year`, but not for other Continents.  How many rows does your dataframe
> have and why?
>

> ## Challenge 2
>
>
> Calculate the average life expectancy per country. Which has the longest average life
> expectancy and which has the shortest average life expectancy?
>



> ## Advanced Challenge
>
> Calculate the average life expectancy in 2002 of 2 randomly selected countries
> for each continent. Then arrange the continent names in reverse order.
> **Hint:** Use the `dplyr` functions `arrange()` and `sample_n()`, they have
> similar syntax to other dplyr functions.

# 8. plotting

> ## Challenge 1
>
> Modify the example so that the figure shows how life expectancy has
> changed over time:
>
> ```{r, eval=FALSE}
> ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point()
> ```
>
> Hint: the gapminder dataset has a column called "year", which should appear
> on the x-axis.
>


>
> ## Challenge 2
>
> In the previous examples and challenge we've used the `aes` function to tell
> the scatterplot **geom** about the **x** and **y** locations of each point.
> Another *aesthetic* property we can modify is the point *color*. Modify the
> code from the previous challenge to **color** the points by the "continent"
> column. What trends do you see in the data? Are they what you expected?
>


> ## Challenge 4a
>
> Modify the color and size of the points on the point layer in the previous
> example.
>
> Hint: do not use the `aes` function.
>



> ## Challenge 4b
>
> Modify your solution to Challenge 4a so that the
> points are now a different shape and are colored by continent with new
> trendlines.  Hint: The color argument can be used inside the aesthetic.
