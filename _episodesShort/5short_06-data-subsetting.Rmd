```{r, include=FALSE}
source("../bin/chunk-options-short.R")
knitr_fig_path("06-")
# Silently load in the data so the rest of the lesson works
gapminder <- read.csv("../data/gapminder_data.csv", header=TRUE)
```


six  ways to subset

```{r}
x <- c(41,42,43,44,45)
names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e') # these should be unique
x

# alt way to make it
x <- c(a=41, b=42, c=43, d=44, e=45) # names
x
```

## Accessing elements using their indices

place in the vector = index

```{r}
x[1]
x[4]
```


```{r}

x[c(1,4)] # note the difference between round parenthesis and square braket here

1:4
x[1:4]

x[c(1,1,3)] # same element multiple times
```

```{r}
x[6] # beyond length
```

This is a vector of length one containing an `NA`, whose name is also `NA`.

If we ask for the 0th element, we get an empty vector:

```{r}
x[0] # empty vector (note for those with programming experiment in other languages)
```

## Skipping and removing elements

```{r}
x[-2] # every element *except*

x[c(-1, -5)]  # or x[-c(1,5)]
x[-1:3]
-1:3
x[-(1:3)]

x # doesn't change the original vector
```

## Subsetting by name

this is more robust,  will survive sorts

```{r}
x[c("a", "c")]
```

## Subsetting through other logical operations

We can also use any logical vector to subset:

```{r}
x[c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

```{r}
x > 43
x[x > 43]
```

Combining logical conditions

```{r}

x > 43 & x < 45
x == 42 | x > 44

c(TRUE,TRUE) & c(FALSE, TRUE)

# ! converts true to false; false to true
4 == 5 
!(4 == 5)

4 != 5

!c(TRUE,FALSE)
```

## Skipping named elements

Skipping or removing named elements is a little harder. If we try to skip one named element by negating the string, R complains (slightly obscurely) that it doesn't know how to take the negative of a string:

```{r}
x[-"a"] # error

x[names(x) != "a"]
```

Skipping multiple named indices is a little bit harder still. Suppose we want to drop the `"a"` and `"c"` elements, so we try this:

```{r}
x[names(x)!=c("a","c")] # WRONG!
```

what happened?

### Recycling

Let's take a look at the comparison component of this code:

```{r}
names(x) != c("a", "c")
```

Why does R give `FALSE` as the third element of this vector, when `names(x)[3] != "c"` is obviously false?
When you use `!=`, R tries to compare each element
of the left argument with the corresponding element of its right
argument. What happens when you compare vectors of different lengths?

![Inequality testing](../fig/06-rmd-inequality.1.png)

When one vector is shorter than the other, it gets *recycled*:

![Inequality testing: results of recycling](../fig/06-rmd-inequality.2.png)

warning because trailing "c"

if `names(x)` had contained six elements, R would *silently* have done the wrong thing (i.e., not what we intended it to do). This recycling rule can can introduce hard-to-find and subtle bugs!

solution:
`%in%`

```{r}
x[ ! names(x) %in% c("a","c") ]
```

## Handling special values

missing, infinite, undefined

There are a number of special functions you can use to filter out this data:

 * `is.na` will return all positions in a vector, matrix, or data.frame
   containing `NA` (or `NaN`)
 * likewise, `is.nan`, and `is.infinite` will do the same for `NaN` and `Inf`.
 * `is.finite` will return all positions in a vector, matrix, or data.frame
   that do not contain `NA`, `NaN` or `Inf`.
 * `na.omit` will filter out all missing values from a vector

## Factor subsetting

Now that we've explored the different ways to subset vectors, how
do we subset the other data structures?

Factor subsetting works the same way as vector subsetting.

```{r}
f <- factor(c("a", "a", "b", "c", "c", "d"))
f[f == "a"]
f[f %in% c("b", "c")]
f[1:3]
```

Skipping elements will not remove the level
even if no more of that category exists in the factor:

```{r}
f[-3]
```

## Matrix subsetting

Matrices are also subsetted using the `[` function. In this case
it takes two arguments: the first applying to the rows, the second
to its columns:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
m <- matrix(rnorm(6*4), ncol=4, nrow=6)
m[3:4, c(3,1)]
```

You can leave the first or second arguments blank to retrieve all the
rows or columns respectively:

```{r}
m[, c(3,4)]
```

If we only access one row or column, R will automatically convert the result
to a vector:

```{r}
m[3,]
```

If you want to keep the output as a matrix, you need to specify a *third* argument;
`drop = FALSE`:

```{r}
m[3, , drop=FALSE]
```

Unlike vectors, if we try to access a row or column outside of the matrix,
R will throw an error:

```{r, error=TRUE}
m[, c(3,6)]
```


mention: Higher dimensional arrays


```{r}
matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3)
```

If you wish to populate the matrix by row, use `byrow=TRUE`:

```{r}
matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
```

Matrices can also be subsetted using their rownames and column names
instead of their row and column indices.

## List subsetting

three functions to subset lists :  `[`, `[[`, and `$`.

```{r}
xlist <- list(a = "Software Carpentry", b = 1:10, data = head(iris))
xlist[1] # [  will always return a list --- useful for subsetting a list
str(xlist[1])

# to get the value at the index
xlist[[1]]
str(xlist[[1]])
```

```{r, error=TRUE}
xlist[1:2]
xlist[[1:2]] # can't extract more than one element at once
```

Nor use it to skip elements:

```{r, error=TRUE}
xlist[[-1]]
```

But you can use names to both subset and extract elements:

```{r}
xlist[["a"]]
```

The `$` function is a shorthand way for extracting elements by name:

```{r}
xlist$data
```

> ## Challenge 5
> Given the following list:
>
> ```{r, eval=FALSE}
> xlist <- list(a = "Software Carpentry", b = 1:10, data = head(iris))

> ## Challenge 6
> Given a linear model:
>
> ```{r, eval=FALSE}
> mod <- aov(pop ~ lifeExp, data=gapminder)
> ```
>

> > ```
> > ```{r, eval=FALSE}
> > mod$df.residual
> > ```
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}


## Data frames

data frames = lists 

```{r}
head(iris)

iris["Sepal.Length"]
iris[["Sepal.Length"]]

# also kinda like a matrix
iris[1:4,1:3]
iris[1,]
iris[2:4,]
```

# STOP HERE


```{r}
head(gapminder[3])
```

Similarly, `[[` will act to extract *a single column*:

```{r}
head(gapminder[["lifeExp"]])
```

And `$` provides a convenient shorthand to extract columns by name:

```{r}
head(gapminder$year)
```

With two arguments, `[` behaves the same way as for matrices:

```{r}
gapminder[1:3,]
```

If we subset a single row, the result will be a data frame (because
the elements are mixed types):

```{r}
gapminder[3,]
```

But for a single column the result will be a vector (this can
be changed with the third argument, `drop = FALSE`).
