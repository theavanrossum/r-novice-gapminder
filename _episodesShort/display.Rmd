# 6. 5 data structures 2

> ## Challenge 1
> Let's imagine that 1 human year is equivalent to 7 cat years. 
> 1. Create a vector called `human_age` by multiplying `cats$age` by 7.
> 2. Convert `human_age` to a factor.
> 3. Convert `human_age` back to a numeric vector using the `as.numeric()` function. Now divide it by 7 to get the original ages back. Explain what happened.
>
> > ## Solution to Challenge 1
> > 1. `human_age <- cats$age * 7`
> > 2. `human_age <- factor(human_age)`. `as.factor(human_age)` works just as well.
> > 3. `as.numeric(human_age)` yields `1 2 3 4 4` because factors are stored as integers (here, 1:4), each of which is associated with a label (here, 28, 35, 56, and 63). Converting the factor to a numeric vector gives us the underlying integers, not the labels. If we want the original numbers, we need to convert `human_age` to a character vector and then to a numeric vector (why does this work?). This comes up in real life when we accidentally include a character somewhere in a column of a .csv file supposed to only contain numbers, and forget to set `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` when we read in the data.
